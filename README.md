# PS-AmericanStatesCounter
A little PowerShell script that lets the user guess as many American states as they can before giving up.

Context: Still learning how to use PS and making this is a learning process as well as good fun.

## TODO ##

Create a function to filter out words that are not American states by comparing the $states array to the $statesTemp array.

Get the count of states named by the user by comparing the $states and $statesTemp array and using the logic (.length-.length).


## IN PROGRESS ##

Get $input from user to parse as an Object type to the array $statesTemp as it is currently a String.
